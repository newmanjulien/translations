But the worst enemy thou canst meet, wilt thou thyself always be; thou waylayest thyself in caverns and forests.
- You're your own worst enemy
- You will be the one stopping yourself from going down the right pathj

Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way to thyself! And past thyself and thy seven devils leadeth thy way!
- If you chose to leave the herd
- You will be tempted by your nature (7 capital sins)

A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a soothsayer, and a fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.
- You will stop believing in yourself
- You will lie to yourself and confuse yourself
- You will self-sabotage

Ready must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame; how couldst thou become new if thou have not first become ashes!
- If you're serious about leaving the herd and becoming yourself
- You need to first burn down who you were
- So you can become who you truly are
